## Azure DNS Private Resolver

Microsoft has released new Azure DNS Private Resolver service to simplify hybrid recursive DNS resolution. This reference architecture demonstrates how a hybrid Domain Name System (DNS) solution can be designed using Microsoft Azure Private DNS Resolver for workloads running both on-premises and in Microsoft Azure.

Azure offers various types of DNS solutions, as described below:

Azure offers various types of DNS solutions, as described below:
- Azure Public DNS: This is the default DNS resolution for all Azure virtual networks and it is maintained and managed by Microsoft.

- Azure Traffic manager: Acts as a DNS-based load balancing service, allowing us to distribute traffic across Azure regions to the public facing applications.

- Private DNS: You can use Azure DNS private zones to resolve your own domain names and virtual machine names without having to configure a custom solution without modifying your own configuration. When deploying, you can also use your own custom domain name instead of Azure's provided names if you use private DNS zones.

- Azure DNS Resolver (Preview): is a cloud-native, highly available, and DevOps-friendly service. It provides a simple, zero-maintenance, reliable, and secure DNS service to resolve DNS names hosted in Azure DNS private zones 



### Why Azure DNS Private Resolver:
Prior to Azure DNS Private Resolver, customers must set up custom DNS servers to enable DNS resolution from on-premises to Azure (and vice versa). Below are the typical challenges associated with custom DNS solutions.

- Managing multiple custom DNS servers for multiple virtual networks requires high infrastructure and licensing costs.
- The customer must handle all aspects of installing, configuring, and maintaining DNS servers.
- Overheads such as monitoring, and patching of these servers become complex and prone to failure.
- There is no DevOps support for customers to manage their DNS records and forwarding rules
- Costs associated with implementing scalable customer DNS server solutions are high.



Here are the features and key advantages that Azure DNS Private Resolver brings to the table.

- A fully managed Microsoft service with high availability and zone redundancy built in for better availability and service reliability.
- Very scalable and friendly to DevOps.
- A cost saving when compared with traditional IaaS-based custom solutions.
- The Outbound Endpoint brings conditional forwarding capability for Azure DNS to on-premises that has never been possible before.
